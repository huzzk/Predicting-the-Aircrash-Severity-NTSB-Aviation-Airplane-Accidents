# Predicting-the-Aircrash-Severity-NTSB-Aviation-Airplane-Accidents

## Introduction

The popularity of air travel has increased due to its convenience, speed, and affordability, but it is not risk-free. The National Transportation Safety Board investigates aircraft accidents in the United States to determine their causes. This study aims to examine the causes of air crashes in the United States, predict the severity of airplane accidents based on past incidents, and identify the factors that affect the severity of an airplane crash. The study provides valuable insights into air crash causes that can be used to improve flight safety. The study recommends using machine learning to improve the quality and utilization of accident reports, enhancing flight skills and decision-making, emphasizing the importance of weather briefings, preflight preparation, and weather-based risk management, creating an aviation-specific corpus for text mining, and finding ways to gather and publish more open-source flight data for safety modeling. The focus of this project is to predict the severity of airplane crashes using machine learning models. The dataset used contains information on airplane crashes, including weather conditions, control metrics, and flight phase. The target variable is the severity of the crash, categorized into four levels based on the extent of damage and injuries.
